# Static binaries

A complete installation from source is often non necessary as we provide static binaries of the latest release version in `bin/thorin_v1.2_static`.

The executable files only support a 64-bit operating system on the x86_64 CPU platform and require AVX2 support. The files are released under the MIT license.
