## Rationale

Assortative mating, that is, the tendency for individuals to select partners with similar characteristics, leaves detectable imprints in an individual's genome: when parents are genetically similar for a trait, the alleles they transmit tend to align more than expected under random mating, resulting in similar distributions of trait-associated alleles on the maternal and paternal haplotypes. Consequently, PGS computed from the two parental haplotypes of an individual are expected to correlate. Exploiting this phenomenon, we can estimate GAM by correlating maternal and paternal haplotype-based PGS across individuals. 

To estimate genetic assortative mating (GAM) from biobank individuals, in the absence of mate-pairs, we first reconstructed and separated maternally and paternally inherited haplotypes. For this, we first followed [our pipeline](https://rjhfmstr.github.io/THORIN/docs/tutorials/interchrs.html) to perform inter-chromosomal phasing from inferred surrogate parents.

Following steps to estimate GAM from inferred parental haplotypes will soon be added.
