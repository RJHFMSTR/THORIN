# Tutorials

We are currently developping tutorials to help you to get used with THORIN. These tutorials will cover basic notions such as IBD mapping.

In addition, we will also provide tutorials to describe and help applying the entire parent-of-origin inference pipeline. This pipeline will requires several steps, such as IBD mapping, phasing and imputations. We are currently adapting our UK Biobank and Estonian Biobank pipeline to fit the 1000 Genome Project, so that the publicly available genotype data of the 1000 Genome Project will serve as reference and example data.

## Current stage


We have adapted our script and pipeline that we use to infer the PofO of alleles in the UK Biobank, to fit the 1,000 Genome Project data. The goal of this it to provide example that and script that are up and running for everyone.

This tutorial is now complete and cover all our inference step, from the download of the example data, to IBD mapping, phasing, imputation, and lastly encoding of the two parental haplotypes.

The final files of this pipeline, that is, parental haplotypes, can directly be used in GWAS to identify parent-of-origin effects.

## System requirements

We are running all our experiments on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
