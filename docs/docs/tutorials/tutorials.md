# Tutorials

We provide here tutorials to help you to get used with THORIN, and infer the parent-of-origin of alleles.

The `Toy example` tutorial allows you to get use to IBD mapping using our tool THORIN.


In addition, we also provide a multi-step tutorials to describe and help applying the entire parent-of-origin inference pipeline. For the scope of this tutorial, we have adapted our scripts to fit the 1000 Genome Project, so that the publicly available genotype data of the 1000 Genome Project will serve as reference and example data. The goal of this it to provide example that and script that are up and running for everyone.

## Current stage

This tutorial is now complete and cover all our inference step, from the download of the example data, to IBD mapping, phasing, imputation, and lastly encoding of the two parental haplotypes.

The final files of this pipeline, that is, parental haplotypes, can directly be used in GWAS to identify parent-of-origin effects.

## System requirements

We are running all our experiments on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
