# Tutorials

We are currently developping tutorials to help you to get used with THORIN. These tutorials will cover basic notions such as IBD mapping.

In addition, we will also provide tutorials to describe and help applying the entire parent-of-origin inference pipeline. This pipeline will requires several steps, such as IBD mapping, phasing and imputations. We are currently adapting our UK Biobank and Estonian Biobank pipeline to fit the 1000 Genome Project, so that the publicly available genotype data of the 1000 Genome Project will serve as reference and example data.
