# Tutorials

We are currently developping tutorials to help you to get used with THORIN. These tutorials will cover basic notions such as IBD mapping.

In addition, we will also provide tutorials to describe and help applying the entire parent-of-origin inference pipeline. This pipeline will requires several steps, such as IBD mapping, phasing and imputations. We are currently adapting our UK Biobank and Estonian Biobank pipeline to fit the 1000 Genome Project, so that the publicly available genotype data of the 1000 Genome Project will serve as reference and example data.

## Current stage

We are currently still adapting our pipelines to the 1,000 Genome Project data and posting the updates in real time. Hence, the tutorial presented in this section are still incomplete.

## System requirements

We are running all our experiments on Ubuntu 20.04.
