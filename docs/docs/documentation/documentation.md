Description of input files, output files, command line options and basic usage of THORIN.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The THORIN tool maps Identity-By-Descent between a focal individual and the specified reference individuals.

We explain below the basic usage of the THORIN tool and the structure of the data allowing "single reference individual" based IBD mapping, or "grouped reference" based IBD mapping. We then explain the different outputs provided by the THORIN tool, all based on the same basic usage.
