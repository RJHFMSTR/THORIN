# Documentation

Command-line documentation and usage of THORIN.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The THORIN tool maps Identity-By-Descent between a focal individual and the specified reference individuals. The reference individuals can be specified separately, to obtain IBD between the focal individuals and each of the reference individuals. The reference individuals can also be grouped, which will merge overlapping IBD tile shared with each reference individual of the same group into a longer IBD segment.

We explain below the basic usage of the THORIN tool and the structure of the data allowing "single reference individual" based IBD mapping, or "grouped reference" based IBD mapping. We then explain the different outputs provided by the THORIN tool, all based on the same basic usage.
